### This repository

Using this repository to try out my C again. I still have a lot to practice.

## Files

Don't trust this code. It's an experiment, like I said, to practice C again and
some codes are incomplete or not working the way they should.

## Help

If you have any tips about coding in C they are more than welcome :)
